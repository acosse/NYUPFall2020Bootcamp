The first one is to start from a node and generate its children with fixed probabilities, lets says p(x has one child) = p_1,  p(x has two child) = p_2,... This first approach is known as Galton Watson. The alternative is to rely on the notion of Prufer sequence. A tree with n nodes can be uniquely expressed by a sequence of n-2 integer numbers (in the range of [0, n-1]). You can generate such a sequence at random. The sequence can be used to generate a tree (see for example [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%BCfer_sequence))\n",
